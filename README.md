> Quizics is a physics quiz, using exam questions. It allows teachers to add questions to a pool of questions that are picked randomly when a quiz is requested – when a quiz is generated the number of questions can be chosen. Teachers may also add users and set their username and password, as well as to assign them a year group. Alternatively, a SUVAT quiz can be generated randomly – a set number of questions can be generated which can be completed interactively or printed into a worksheet which can be handed to students and marked by a teacher. A main menu bar at the top of the application is used to navigate between the different windows within the application, for example to open a new quiz. Users must log in to use the system, and when a teacher logs in they have access to other settings; allowing them to edit existing users and questions, delete or add them. Alternatively, users can change their own passwords.
